* start with main fn always like :
     fn main () {
        //code here
     }
* print! and println! both are same but ln add new line at end of the output

* assign variable as let :
    let a =

* cant use diff data type in array , but can use in tuples

* rust have title which is able to talk with complier before the executions

* we can decalre bunch variable without intiallized value , assign latter and can be muteable and diff data value too

* rust have data type with bits and each bits store some limited values only and the data type can be assign prefix or sufix and even rust have some scitfic values too

* w can assign values by using diff types like binary, decimal, otco, hexa decimal (see the code comp_values for better understanding)
